                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The Casa Conejo Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) serves Casa Conejo residents, and makes recommendations to the Board of Supervisors. Its purpose is to provide a forum for Casa Conejo residents to discuss issues and come with ideas to the Board of Supervisors. While numerous other unincorporated islands were ultimately annexed by the City of Thousand Oaks during the 1980s, Casa Conejo voters rejected such efforts and remains an unincorporated pocket surrounded by Newbury Park. While Newbury Park is in Thousand Oaks, Casa Conejo is in Newbury Park but not in Thousand Oaks.</p>
