                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Nesquehoning was established as a result of the anthracite coal mining industry. It was incorporated as a borough in 1963 (effective in 1964), having previously been a part of Mauch Chunk Township west of the Lehigh River. The borough's name is of Native American origin, commonly believed to signify 'narrow valley;' however native language scholars translate the name as 'at the black lick' or 'at the dirty lick,' referring to mineral licks frequented by deer or other animals.</p>
